      <h2>Discover Martini</h2>
      <p>Having worked an array of roles across a range of film sets, I found that independent film sets in particular
        can be a dynamic environment that can be hard to keep track of. This led me to pitch a workspace tool for
        filmmakers from all backgrounds that helped maintain the structure of a studio environment and guide first-time
        creators through the process.</p>
      <p> The tool is primarily an aid for ADs, directors and producers to help keep track of each department and stay
        on schedule. It will provide regular updates on sudden changes throughout the day, keep track of cast and crew
        and assist with the creation of doccuments such as shot lists and call sheets. The app is still currently in
        development and our team of two is working hard to ensure our final product is as accessible as possible to all
        people.</p>
